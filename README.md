##  Weather App
### Forecast- A Weather App

This is a weather app made using the OpenWeatherMap API and jQuery. Animations were created using HTML5 Canvas. Icons are from Noun Project.
<br>
<strong>##Android App</strong>
<br>
Later on ported this web app into a native android app using Apache Cordova Framework (Phone Gap).
<br>
The android application does not asks for any permission. However, it might use the gps sometimes to determine the current location.

I wanted to spend some time learning jQuery and HTML5 Canvas. This is basically my first app made using html canvas, so there's a lot of room for improvements.

**Feel free to use this code, but please create your own API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) so that it doesn't get blocked due to overuse. Thank you.**
